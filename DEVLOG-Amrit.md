## Amrit Das 

### 2025-05-22 - Brief description
I, really quickly, created each of the classes. And I have started to think about implementation.

### 2025-05-23 - Brief description

During class(40mins)- I have started to think more about the implementation of tiles and the dictionary--especially how they work together. I am starting to code using the Scanner classses.

## 2025-05-25- Brief Description

5 mins - worked on understanding branching
15 mins- working on scanner classes and working on using binary search in order to find the words
5 mins- brainstorming about how to use maze carver to create the board and testing of comparisons

## 2025-05-27- Brief Description
In- class:
10 mins- worked on brainstorming and better planning how to create the board for the game in the Board class as well as creating multiple arrays
15mins- manually writing the multipliers for the letters on the board
10mins- manually writing the multipliers for the words on the board

At- Home:
10 mins- working on creating compatiability between the player class and the board class
10 mins- working on processing(not added to git yet--currently just experimenting)

## 2025-05-28- Brief Description
In- Class:

10mins- worked with Harrison on ensuring the git branches were all working properly and starting with the thing known as processing

## 2025-05-29- Brief Description

40mins- working on transferring the Board to processing. Invovlved reviewing some basics of this interface.
25mins- working on the board to processing. successful now.

## 2025-05-30- Brief Description

10mins- working on debugging the board so it matches the actual scrabble board

## 2025-06-02- Brief Description

2.5hrs(home)- working on ensuring the board was working. Harrison had already ensured that the tiles dropping and dragging was functional. My role was to compare tile patterns to the dictionary as well as refreshing the tilePool per turn. This took a lot of functions and trial/error runs as I had to consider that words can occur both horizontally and vertically, hence, we needed to check both directions to see if a word was made possible. The clearing/resetting of the tilePool was straightforward and just involved adding a line of code at the end.

10mins(class)- working with Harrison to check our MVP and see what went right and wrong. We see we need to add confirm buttons, make our checker for the points more accurate, and try to make it two player
20mins(class)- working with Harrison to start to implement the confirm button

## 2025-06-03

30mins(class) - working on making the confirm button for a word functional. This involved editing the mouseClicked function as well as our word checking functions in order to ensure proper functionality.

## 2025-06-04

30mins(class)- still debugging the confirm button...I am unsure why it's glitching but I will work on it to make it better.
10mins- planning with Harrison how to debug, merge, and plan for our video submission

## 2025-06-06

30mins(class)- worked the debugging on the confirm button by testing using the printing of array coordinates
10mins(class)- astarted to work during the class period on the issue of why the confirm button is not checking the dictionary if we have a word or not...which is an issue

## Weekend of 2025-06-06

1hr(home)- working on ensuring that the scoring calculator works as intended in the additions, wordlehor, wordlever functions which required serious debugging due to dictionary and logical flaws
1hr(home)- working on debugging for logical issues in the scoring claculator and reforming the methods to take into account that scrabble words build off of already placed tiles
1hr(home) -working with Harrison on last minute score debugging, rule setting, and video filming

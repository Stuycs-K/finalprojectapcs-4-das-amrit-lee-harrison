# Project Description

Period 4
Amrit Das and Harrison Lee

Our project intends to create a (slightly!) modified version of the Scrabble game. Most of the rules, tiles, and behaviors are the same with a few key exceptions.
We have a 2-player game where both players are tasked with placing tiles down to make word and will try to compete until the board is full, or until they get a wrong word. 


# Intended usage:

Intended Amount of Players: 1- 2(if you want to solo play--you compete against yourself!!)
Once the drawing is intitialised in Processing, you can start playing the game as you would normal scrabble.

- Your first step is to click on one of the brown tiles offered in your hand. Upon clicking, you are locked onto that tile, and you must put it on the board.
        Note: if you are the first to place a tile, you must start on the central red square.
- Then, you try to fill a word. You can go either vertical or perpendicular-- diagonal words DO NOT count. This is repeatedly putting the tile in the manner that you want.
- Once you get a word, you hit the confirm button which will check if your word is valid and you are awarded points that you can see on the bottom right of your game setup. The player now switches.
- Player 2 continues as normal, with the placing of tiles. YOU MAY NOT place tiles in a different section of the board. You MUST build words off of tiles that player 1 placed down as long as they follow the vertical and perpendicular behaviors.


The amount to win is **35 points**
